I'd say I understand how LLMs work. I've trained models, built machine learning systems and read many of the foundational papers. But over the last few years, models have grown from something that could fit on a single GPU to systems trained across thousands of accelerators.

At some point, I realized there was a gap in my understanding. I could explain the Transformer architecture, but what I couldn't explain was how any of this actually scales. Answers to questions like - how do you train a model that doesn't fit on a single machine? What happens when thousands of accelerators need to communicate every step? I sort of had an idea, but I wanted to really dive into it.

Google's *How to Scale Your Model* is one of the few resources I've found that focuses on these questions directly. So here is my journey through the book and my thoughts overall.

## Part 1: Rooflines

The first section of the scaling book introduces rooflines, which is a useful mental model. Before reading this chapter, I mostly thought about model performance in terms of raw compute, but this chapter really made me appreciate how often the bottleneck is actually memory bandwidth.

The roofline model gives a simple way to reason about this tradeoff. Some operations are compute-bound, where performance is limited by the accelerator's peak FLOPs. Others are memory-bound, where the limiting factor is how quickly data can move between the memory and compute units.

I think part 1 took me some time to get used to this sort of thinking model, but once it clicked, the answers to the questions came easier.

## Part 2: TPUs

This section was definitely drier than the other chapters. The main thing I took away was the difference in philosophy between GPUs and TPUs. GPUs were originally built for graphics and later evolved into highly flexible parallel processors, while TPUs are much more specialized. TPUs heavily optimize matrix multiplication using systolic arrays, where data flows through a coordinated pipeline rather than treating operations independently. The questions in this section introduced interesting concepts.

## Part 3: Sharding

This was by far the hardest chapter in the book, and the one I spent the most time on. It's incredibly dense, introducing both the mechanics of sharding tensors across devices and the communication patterns required to make distributed computation work. The exercises were significantly more challenging than the previous chapters, but they also forced me to slow down and build intuition instead of skimming through the material.

One thing I appreciated was how the chapter systematically derives the four ways to perform distributed matrix multiplication depending on how the input matrices are sharded. It also introduces the four core communication primitives: AllGather, ReduceScatter, AllReduce, and AllToAll. Before this chapter, I knew what these operations did at a high level from seeing them in papers. What I didn't understand was the mathematical reasoning behind them: why each primitive is needed, what information is being communicated, and how they naturally arise from different sharding strategies. I found myself constantly coming back to concepts introduced in this chapter.

### Takeaways

<B> The four communication primitives introduced in this chapter: </B>
    
* **AllGather:** Every device collects the shards from all other devices to reconstruct the full tensor. Intuitively, it removes a sharding dimension.

*   **ReduceScatter:** Performs a reduction across devices while simultaneously scattering the reduced result so each device keeps only its assigned shard. Intuitively, it does the opposite of an AllGather and so requires the same amount of time
        
*   **AllReduce:** Values are reduced (e.g., summed) across all devices, and the final result is broadcast back to every device. This is essentially a ReduceScatter followed by and AllGather.
        
*   **AllToAll:** Devices exchange different shards with one another so that each device ends up owning a different partition of the data. Intuitively, this means moving a sharding axis from one dimension to another. 

Distributed matrix multiplication boils down to four sharding cases.

1. No sharding along the contracting dimension

   Each device has all the data it needs, so the multiplication can be performed locally with **no communication**.

   \[
   \mathbf{A}[I_X, J] \cdot \mathbf{B}[J, K_Y]
   \rightarrow
   \mathbf{C}[I_X, K_Y]
   \]

2. One input is sharded along the contracting dimension

   The computation is

   \[
   \mathbf{A}[I, J_X] \cdot \mathbf{B}[J, K_Y]
   \rightarrow
   \mathbf{C}[I, K_Y]
   \]

   Before this can happen, we first perform an AllGather:

   \[
   \mathbf{A}[I, J]
   =
   \mathrm{AllGather}_X(\mathbf{A}[I, J_X])
   \]

3. Both inputs are sharded along the contracting dimension

   Each device computes a partial result locally, and the partial outputs are summed with an **AllReduce** (or **ReduceScatter** if the output should remain sharded).

   \[
   \mathbf{A}[I, J_X] \cdot \mathbf{B}[J_X, K] \rightarrow \mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{partial}}[I, K]
   \]

   Combine partial sums:

   \[
   \mathbf{C}[I, K]
   =
   \mathrm{AllReduce}(\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{partial}})
   \]

   or, if the output remains sharded:

   \[
   \mathbf{C}[I_X, K]
   =
   \mathrm{ReduceScatter}(\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{partial}})
   \]

4. Both inputs are sharded along the non-contracting dimension

   One of the matrices must be redistributed before the multiplication can be performed efficiently.

   \[
   \mathbf{A}[I_X, J] \cdot \mathbf{B}[J, K_X] \rightarrow \mathbf{C}[I_X, K_X]
   \]

   AllGather one of the dimensions and then perform the matrix multiply.

## Part 4: Seeing the Transformer Come Together

After spending so much time in Part 3 dealing with the mechanics of distributed computation, sharding, and communication, Part 4 felt like a breath of fresh air. Instead of reasoning about abstract matrix multiplications and collective operations in isolation, we finally get to see how those ideas map onto a real transformer.

## Part 5: Parallelism Strategies Behind Modern LLM Training

Part 5 was probably the first section where several concepts that I had only heard mentioned before finally clicked.

Terms like data parallelism, tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and FSDP are everywhere when reading about large-scale training. They often appear as buzzwords in papers and engineering blogs, but without understanding the underlying tensor layouts, it is difficult to understand why one method is chosen over another.

Here are the 4 parallelism schemes discussed in this section. Each scheme can be thought of as uniquely defined by a sharding for `In`, `W_in`, `W_out`, and `Out`.

### Data Parallelism (DP)

Activations are sharded along the batch dimension, while parameters and optimizer state are replicated on each device.

\[
\text{In}[B_X, D] \cdot_D W_{\text{in}}[D, F] \cdot_F W_{\text{out}}[F, D] \rightarrow \text{Out}[B_X, D]
\]

### Fully-Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP / ZeRO-3)

Activations are sharded along the batch dimension, like pure data parallelism. Parameters are sharded along the same mesh axis. Optimizer state is also sharded along the batch dimension. This reduces duplicated memory.

\[
\text{In}[B_X, D] \cdot_D W_{\text{in}}[D_X, F] \cdot_F W_{\text{out}}[F, D_X] \rightarrow \text{Out}[B_X, D]
\]

### Tensor Parallelism (Megatron Sharding)

Activations are sharded along \(D\) (\(d_{\text{model}}\)), and parameters are sharded along \(F\) (\(d_{ff}\)).

\[
\text{In}[B, D_Y] \cdot_D W_{\text{in}}[D, F_Y] \cdot_F W_{\text{out}}[F_Y, D] \rightarrow \text{Out}[B, D_Y]
\]

### Pipeline Parallelism (PP)

Weights are sharded along the layer dimension, and activations are microbatched and rolled along the layer dimension. Communication between pipeline stages is minimal — just moving activations over a single hop.

\[
\text{In}[L_Z, B, D][i] \cdot_D W_{\text{in}}[L_Z, D, F][i] \cdot_F W_{\text{out}}[L_Z, F, D][i] \rightarrow \text{Out}[L_Z, B, D][i]
\]

### Mixed Parallelism

Modern frontier models usually combine all of these techniques.

**Combining FSDP and Tensor Parallelism**

Syntax:

\[
\text{In}[B_X, D_Y] \cdot_D W_{\text{in}}[D_X, F_Y] \cdot_F W_{\text{out}}[F_Y, D_X] \rightarrow \text{Out}[B_X, D_Y]
\]
