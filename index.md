Welcome to my blog.

This site is now set up to publish posts written in Markdown. Add a new file under the _posts folder with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md` and GitHub Pages will turn it into a post automatically.

## Recent posts

<ul>
{% for post in site.posts %}
  <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> — <small>{{ post.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}</small></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
